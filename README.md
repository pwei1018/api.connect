# BC Registries & Digital Services - API Users Group

Welcome to the central communication and collaboration hub for the **API Users Group** and the **BC Registries Digital Services** product teams. 


This repository does not host code. Instead, it is a dedicated workspace used exclusively for **Discussions** (announcements, Q&A, ideas) and **Issues** (bug reporting, feature requests, change tracking) across our core service domains.

## 💬 How We Use This Repository

To keep communication organized and ensure the right product team addresses your items quickly, please use the following guidelines:

### 💡 GitHub [Discussions](../../discussions)
*Use Discussions for open-ended conversations, questions, and announcements.*
*   **Announcements:** Look here for upcoming API version releases, planned maintenance windows, and breaking change notifications from our engineering teams.
*   **Q&A:** Stuck on an integration pattern or need clarity on an API contract attribute? Ask the community and core teams here.
*   **Ideas & Feedback:** Share suggestions for workflow improvements or new endpoints you'd like to see.

### 🪲 GitHub [Issues](../../issues)
*Use Issues for structured, actionable tracking.*
*   **Bug Reports:** If an endpoint is returning an unexpected `500` error or data payload mismatch against the schema, open an issue using our bug template.
*   **Change Requests:** Request specific, concrete modifications to existing endpoints or request access to new webhooks.

> ⚠️ **Important Security Reminder:** Never post sensitive data, real API keys, bearer tokens, or personally identifiable information (PII) in Issues or Discussions. Always use mock data or sanitized payloads when reproducing errors.

## 🤖 Q&A Auto-Responder

New discussions posted in the **Q&A** category are automatically answered by a bot (`.github/workflows/qa-bot.yml`). It grounds its replies in:
*   Previously answered Q&A discussions in this repository.
*   The documentation in [bcgov/developer.connect](https://github.com/bcgov/developer.connect)'s `web/site/content` folder.

If no relevant context is found, it tags `@pwei1018` (configurable via the `QA_BOT_MAINTAINERS_MENTION` repository variable) for manual follow-up instead of guessing. It generates answers using the [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli-in-actions) (`copilot -p ... -s --no-ask-user`), authenticated via the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the `copilot-requests: write` permission — no external secrets required (assuming your org's "Allow use of Copilot CLI billed to the organization" policy is enabled; otherwise a PAT can be substituted, see the workflow's comments).

## 📬 Contact & Support
If you are experiencing a critical production outage or an issue containing confidential data that cannot be shared publicly, please contact our enterprise support desk directly rather than opening a public issue.
